# Parallel-Programming
Two simple and straight-forward scripts in R that use Parallel Programming, both threading a multi-core process. Both of them 
were created so the R users would get an idea of parallel programming.

## About the scripts

The scripts were built that way so you can compile a report after running the scripts.

## Built With

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) - The language used
* [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - The IDE

## Authors

* **KarlesP** - *Initial work* - [KarlesP](https://github.com/KarlesP)
